We reviewed the "gofile" ( https://github.com/felipecruz91/gofile ) application Felipe created and its Dockerfile ( https://github.com/felipecruz91/gofil... ). The existing Dockerfile is interesting for a number of reasons. It has a number of good qualities we'll call out and discuss in addition to discussing what kind of improvements to make and what kind of gotchas to watch out for.
